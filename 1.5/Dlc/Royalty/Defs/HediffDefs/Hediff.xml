        <description>A condition that makes a person unable to walk by interfering with the motor
            cortex. After enough time, patients recover naturally as the brain rewires itself, but
            the process is slow. There is also a chance of a lucky early recovery. This illness can
            be completely cured with a special procedure, but the procedure requires large amounts
            of glitterworld medicine.</description>
