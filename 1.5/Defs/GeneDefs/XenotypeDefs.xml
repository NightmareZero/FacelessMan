        <description>A dubious xenogerm of debated origin, wolfmen/lycans have propagated unimpeded
            throughout colonized space to stake territorial claims and establish packs or larger
            clans. Their wolfman form has diminished nocturnal abilities, trading many advantages in
            exchange for being able to share their xenogerm with others.\n\nThere is no clear
            history established regarding the history of lycans, made especially murky as each new
            pack tends to fabricate their own origins. This has led to widely varying conspiracy
            theories, most of which at least partially involve sanguophages, especially due to
            similarities in their genes. The most prevalent one is that a sanguophage fell in love
            with an yttakin, later transforming them into one of their ilk, however there were
            complications as the newly-changed sanguophage was pregnant. The child was born but was
            abandoned by their parents, yet managed to survive living amongst stray dogs. Eventually
            they set out to make their own family, whether through blood or water, and to always
            consider that family comes first.</description>
