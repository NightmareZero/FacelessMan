        <description>The Faceless Ones' origins are shrouded in mystery, with some claiming they are
            the byproduct of laboratory experiments in the pursuit of the ultimate human, while
            others recount that they were selectively bred to serve as stand-ins for dignitaries in
            public settings. Now, they primarily act as diplomats or spies for various factions,
            utilizing their extensive internal gene pool to transform into any race. Coupled with
            their exquisite makeup skills, they can infiltrate any colony or organization and slip
            away unharmed afterward.</description>
